The project describes an application meant to support interactive knowledge assessment, integrating seamlessly into educational environments. The application brings together two categories of users: on one hand, those who serve as test hosts, and on the other, those who are taking the quizzes. Quizzes coordinators have a high level of flexibility in managing question collections, being able to create a set from scratch or use a publicly available one, from another user, during the examination. At the end of the test, participants have access to a personal report on the examination, and the host receives a detailed report that includes relevant statistics about grade distribution and selected answers.
The results obtained from user reviews have shown that the application's functionalities are highly useful and user-friendly, with an intuitive interface. However, the page for editing a question collection requires an improvement in visual appearance.
The conclusions indicate the success of the application in achieving its intended purpose by creating a high-quality platform appreciated by its users.
